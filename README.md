# Water Quality Data Integration Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a scalable and automated solution for processing and analyzing water quality data. The system integrates data from distributed sources, ensures consistency through transformation, and provides actionable insights via interactive visualizations.

The system leverages Docker containers to efficiently handle large datasets by isolating memory usage and optimizing processing speed. The ETL process is designed to be flexible, allowing users to select the state and year for processing, and to run the transformation in a containerized environment for faster execution. After the data is processed, it is loaded into a PostgreSQL database for further analysis and querying.

Technologies Used:

Data Processing: Apache Airflow, Python, Docker
Database Management: PostgreSQL, PostGIS
Backend API: Django REST Framework
Visualization: Power BI
Server Management: Ubuntu, Automated Scripting
